This project is the Blog Post for the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program from Udacity.
I choose to work on a Diabetes Dataset from Kaggle website. This data set contains several medical predictor (independent) variables
and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

In this project I answered three interesting questions..


About Dataset Features
Following are the features provided in the dataset.

Pregnancies = No. of pregnancy
Glucose = Glucose level
Blood Pressure = Plood Pressure of person
SkinThickness = Thickness of the skin
Insulin = Insulin Test results
BMI = Body Mass Index
Diabetes Pedigree Function
Age = Age of the person
Outcome = Target class (wether diabetes or not, 1: diabetec, 0: not diabeteic)
