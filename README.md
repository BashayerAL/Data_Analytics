# Data_Scientist
This project is the Blog Post for the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program from Udacity.
I choose to work on a Diabetes Dataset from Kaggle website. This data set contains several medical predictor (independent) variables
and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.


# Libraries used
*****1- Pandas Library;
Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
2- Numpy Library;
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.NumPy stands for Numerical Python.
3- Matplotlib Library;
Matplotlib is a cross-platform, data visualization and graphical plotting library for Python and its numerical extension NumPy.
4- Seaborn Library ;
Seaborn is an open-source Python library built on top of matplotlib. It is used for data visualization and exploratory data analysis. 
5-Plotly.express Library;
Plotly Express is the easy-to-use, high-level interface to Plotly, which operates on a variety of types of data and produces easy-to-style figures.


# Extra Information:
# %matplotlib inline
It sets the backend of matplotlib to the 'inline' backend: With this backend, the output of plotting commands is displayed inline within frontends like the Jupyter notebook, directly below the code cell that produced it.

# Motivation for the project
My motivation was about answering questions related to the Diabetes. I found my answers in this dataset using python packages pandas , numpy , seaborn , matplotlib ,plotly.express
My questions was about the following:
How many people have diabetes?
How many women are affected by diabetes during pregnancy?
What is the average of Glucose for the people who are affected by diabetes?

# The files in the repository with a small description of each

the code waswrittin by pythin 3 using jypter notbook
-diabetes.csv
the file contains the dataset from Kaggle.
# A summary of the results of the analysis
fter answering three questions we can said , the people who are affected by diabetes is less than who are not. The percentage for the women who are affected by diabetes during pregnancy which is (44.2%).In addition the average of Glucose for the people who are affected by diabetes is 141.26 which is greater than the people who are not affected by diabetes.

 ## About Dataset Features:
Following are the features provided in the dataset.

Pregnancies = No. of pregnancy
Glucose = Glucose level
Blood Pressure = Plood Pressure of person
SkinThickness = Thickness of the skin
Insulin = Insulin Test results
BMI = Body Mass Index
Diabetes Pedigree Function
Age = Age of the person
Outcome = Target class (wether diabetes or not, 1: diabetec, 0: not diabeteic)
